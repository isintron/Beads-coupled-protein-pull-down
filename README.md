# Beads-coupled-protein-pull-down
This repository provides a comprehensive protocol for performing bead-coupled protein pull-down experiments.

The workflow includes detailed steps for the following processes:

1. GST Fusion Protein Expression and Purification: Instructions for generating and purifying GST-tagged fusion proteins from bacterial cultures.
2. Dialysis and Enzymatic Cleavage: Methods for dialysis to remove excess reagents and enzymatic cleavage for tag removal, ensuring optimal protein for pull-down assays.
3. BrCN Coupling: A protocol for coupling target proteins to beads using BrCN-Sepharose for efficient binding.
4. Dynabeads coupling: Detailed steps on activating and coupling proteins to Dynabeads using carboxyl groups for optimal binding efficiency.
5. Embryo Collection and Lysis: Guidelines for the collection and lysis of *Drosophila* embryos.
6. Pull-down Assay: The final step of protein-protein interaction analysis, utilizing the bead-bound proteins to capture interacting partners.

While the embryo collection and lysis step is specifically designed for *Drosophila* embryos, the overall workflow is universal and adaptable to other systems for protein interaction studies.
